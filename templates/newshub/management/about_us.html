			<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Wrong with News in Cambridge?</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cambridge is an amazing place filled with a huge amount of clever people who have interesting things to say. Despite this very few actually get their content read by the audience it deserves. Some go the route of writing for TCS, Varsity or the Tab, but rightly or wrongly many people perceive that this takes a lot of effort or that they need to know the right people to get started. Others create personal blogs where they build up a small group of dedicated readers but fail to grow their readership. Some people write for the many high quality niche publications that while impressive will never become the first choice of the average Cambridge student to read between lectures. Similar problems exist with society blogs who in turn have problems motivating their members to contribute. At the same time we believe that many people are interested in reading this content but shouldn&rsquo;t need to trawl through masses of blogs, society websites and niche publications to find the material that interests them.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that in 2016 news and opinion shouldn&rsquo;t be a simple matter of transcribing a print format online. We believe that allowing users to generate and rapidly respond and interact with content from a broad range of authors in a single platform is the future of campus based publishing. We think that users should be the ones to determine what becomes a front page story and what doesn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How does NewsHub Solve this?</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to solve all of these problems by introducing a new platform that combines the best content from across Cambridge into an easy to access format. Individuals and societies can post articles to NewsHub without editorial control at the click of a button, while readers can access a feed of content that is likely to be of interest and customised for them.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
